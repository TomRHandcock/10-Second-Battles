# 10-Second-Battles
This is a small project which I like to work on in my free time. It uses the Love2d engine which is an open-source framework built around
the lua language. PLEASE NOTE: This game is still in development so it is likely there will be bugs etc. As development continues these
will be found and sorted out.

How to Execute the Game:

The game can be executed from the executable file (10 Second Battles.exe) which is found within the 'executable' folder.

Game Information:

The premise behind 10 Second Battles is a skirmish match between two opponents however, as the name implies, there is only 10 seconds in
which to battle. After these 10 seconds are up the match resets and a new round begins, as you fight with new players the actions you made
in the previous round a replayed along side you allowing for complex battles to be created.

How to Play:

Once the game has loaded you will have the opportunity to select one of your players (represented by red circles), to do so click on one.
This will start the timer which will allow you 10 seconds in order to battle with an enemy AI-controlled player (represented by blue
circles). In order to move around the arrows keys or W, A, S, D keys can be used, the player that you control will always face in the
direction of your mouse cursor and clicking will allow your player to shoot.

Upon the completion of the first round, you will have the opportunity to select another player. Notice that the player you picked previously
if 'greyed out', this means that you have already picked that player and they cannot be picked again. Once you have picked your next
player a new round will begin.

Thank you for your support in taking a look at this project.
